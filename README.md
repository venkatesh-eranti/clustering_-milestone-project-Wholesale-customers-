# clustering_milestone-project-Wholesale-customers-
In this project, I will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure.
* One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. 
* Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer

The wholesale distributor is considering changing its delivery service from currently 5 days a week to 3 days a week. However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively. How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to determine which customers, if any, would reach positively to the change in delivery service?
